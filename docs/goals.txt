#Ideas
   This bot could be able to:
     - Create an event in Google Calendar
     - Read events on Google Calendar (i.e. if an event is updated or cancelled)
     - Tell you the weather for the day and give you advice based on it (if it says it'll be raining, it might suggest you bring your umbrella)
     - Summarize YouTube videos or general text given (?)
     - Reminder at disclosed time
     - Pomodoro Timer with reminders (me like this one)
     - To Do List (maybe into keep notes or just store it somewhere and
        cross out things when they are done (remove them from the list)
        add things to the list
        maybe deadlines could be added to items?
        priority (1 to 5)?
     - Dictionary or Synonym finder (?)
     - Stock price checker (?)
        maybe with the chatgpt api? --> but that would just search for it on the web, no?
     - Snake game (hehe, but how?)

#Ones that should be easier to do
    - Weather telling -- /weather
        maybe we need the time when we want to know the weather

    - Help
        lists all the commands and their workings
    DONE:
